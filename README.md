First session - created a function that generates a random result from the winning options - rock, paper or scissors. I also linked it all to the index file.
Update - I have created a function that generates the computers result, another function that pairs the players input with the computers choice and determines the winner. I have also created a loop that iterates through 5 cycles of the game and sends an alert with the result. There are, however, several problems. The score system does not keep track and the output does not correctly display the computer's nor the player choice correctly. 
Update - two step forward, three back. Managed to get the game working but with problems - it kepy printing out multiple versions of the result and the computer selector was broken. I have fixed one problem but now can't get all the functions to flow together correctly. Next time!
Update - So I had two big ideas while thinking about the problem outside of actually coding. 1. The game function should encompass every other function, so that the other functions are just internal. 2. I should use a switch to determine the winner and loser of each round. I thought this would mean that I wouldn't be able to do an output of what the user and the computer picked, but if I used a template literal I could keep that and not lose that line of output. For the switch statment I tried and failed a few times. So I kept with a separate if elese functions. I had massively overcomplicated the problem and made two functions doing the same thing, but one relied on the other. This meant that my game was working but would output several different results. I think this is because I was trying to use function() == const and the determiner wasn't reading it correctly. However, I found this example on the Odin project examples list https://github.com/BiOHazarD0528 and it really helped me understand how to use the switch more effectively. Now the game seems to work well. Just have to build the visual part of the page now as well.
