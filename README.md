First session - created a function that generates a random result from the winning options - rock, paper or scissors. I also linked it all to the index file.
Update - I have created a function that generates the computers result, another function that pairs the players input with the computers choice and determines the winner. I have also created a loop that iterates through 5 cycles of the game and sends an alert with the result. There are, however, several problems. The score system does not keep track and the output does not correctly display the computer's nor the player choice correctly. 
Update - two step forward, three back. Managed to get the game working but with problems - it kepy printing out multiple versions of the result and the computer selector was broken. I have fixed one problem but now can't get all the functions to flow together correctly. Next time!
